Drakensang Online is a popular MMORPG that offers a rich fantasy world, exciting quests, and epic battles. However, some players may want to experience the game in a different way, such as playing with their friends, exploring older versions of the game, or modifying the game rules. For these players, setting up a private server may be an option.
 
A private server is a server that runs independently from the official servers of Drakensang Online. It allows players to create their own game environment, customize their characters, and access features that are not available on the official servers. However, setting up a private server is not easy, and it may violate the terms of service of Drakensang Online. Therefore, players who want to set up a private server should do so at their own risk and responsibility.

## Step 1: Get the Server Files
 
The first step to set up a private server is to get the server files of Drakensang Online. These are the files that contain the game data and logic that run on the server side. Without them, you cannot run a private server.
 
However, getting the server files is not easy, as they are not publicly available. You will need to contact BigPoint, the developer and publisher of Drakensang Online, and request them directly. However, BigPoint may not grant your request, as they have the exclusive rights to distribute and use the server files. Alternatively, you may try to find some unofficial sources that claim to have the server files, but these may be unreliable, outdated, or infected with malware.
 
Therefore, getting the server files is the most challenging and risky part of setting up a private server. You should be very careful and cautious when dealing with this step.
 
## Step 2: Install and Configure the Server Files
 
Once you have obtained the server files, you will need to install and configure them on your computer or a hosting service. You will need to have some technical knowledge and skills to do this step properly.
 
You will need to follow the instructions that come with the server files or look for some online guides that explain how to install and configure them. You may also need to download and install some additional software or tools that are required for running the server files.
