If My Heart Had Wings -Flight Diary- is a visual novel that follows the stories of the members of the Soaring Club after the events of the original game. However, the Steam version of the game has some drawbacks, such as censored scenes and a poor English translation. Fortunately, there is a way to fix these issues by applying a fan-made patch that restores the original content and replaces the translation with a better one.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the patch, as well as some of the features and benefits of using it. Please note that this patch is not designed for the Steam version of the game, so use it at your own risk. Also, this patch will prevent you from getting any achievements while it is installed, so you may want to backup your save files before proceeding.

## Installing the Patch
 
Before you install the patch, make sure that you have a clean and updated install of If My Heart Had Wings -Flight Diary- on Steam. Also, make sure that you do not have the free Chinese DLC installed, as this will prevent the game from being patched. Run the game once to check that it is working properly, but do not make any saves.
 
To install the patch, open imhhw\_retranslation\_patch\_v1.1.0.59.exe from the folder where you placed it. You will see a window like this:
