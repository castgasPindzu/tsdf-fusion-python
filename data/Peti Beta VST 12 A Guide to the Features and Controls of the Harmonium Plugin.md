If you are looking for a virtual instrument that can emulate the sounds of harmonium, accordion and melodica, you might want to check out Peti Beta VST 12, a new synth from NUSofting. Peti Beta VST 12 is based on a custom FM synthesis engine that can create realistic and expressive sounds of these reed instruments. Peti Beta VST 12 is currently in beta stage, but it is fully functional and comes with 10 presets. You can download it for free from the NUSofting website[^1^].
 
Peti Beta VST 12 allows you to control the simulated bellows mechanism, which is essential for creating the dynamic and breathing quality of these instruments. You can choose from 11 different modes of automatic or manual pumping, and adjust the modulation of the sound parameters accordingly. You can also tweak the harmonics, detune, envelope, vibrato and reverb effects to shape your sound further. Peti Beta VST 12 can produce a wide range of timbres, from accordions to pipe organs, and even the famous melodica often used in reggae dub music.

Here are some tips on how to use Peti Beta VST 12 effectively:
 
- Use the bellows mode that suits your playing style and the genre of music you are making. For example, if you want to create a smooth and sustained sound, you can use the "Auto Slow" mode, which will automatically pump the bellows slowly and evenly. If you want to create a more expressive and dynamic sound, you can use the "Manual" mode, which will let you control the bellows with your MIDI controller or keyboard.
- Experiment with different harmonics settings to change the tone and character of the sound. You can use the "Harmonics" knob to adjust the amount of harmonics added to the sound, and the "Detune" knob to detune the harmonics slightly. You can also use the "Harmonics Type" menu to choose from different types of harmonics, such as "Odd", "Even", "Square", "Saw" and more.
- Use the envelope, vibrato and reverb effects to add more depth and movement to the sound. You can use the "Attack", "Decay", "Sustain" and "Release" knobs to shape the envelope of the sound, and the "Vibrato Depth" and "Vibrato Speed" knobs to adjust the vibrato effect. You can also use the "Reverb Mix" and "Reverb Size" knobs to add some reverb to the sound.
- Try different presets to get inspired by the variety of sounds that Peti Beta VST 12 can produce. You can use the "Preset" menu to choose from 10 presets that cover different styles and genres of music. You can also save your own presets by using the "Save Preset" button.
