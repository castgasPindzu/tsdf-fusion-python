1. Connect the Akai Lpd8 to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Download and install VirtualDJ from [https://www.virtualdj.com/download/index.html](https://www.virtualdj.com/download/index.html) (if you have not done so already).
3. Launch VirtualDJ and log in with your virtualdj.com account credentials. You will need a Pro Infinity, a Pro Subscription or a PLUS License to use the Akai Lpd8 with VirtualDJ. You can buy a license from [https://www.virtualdj.com/buy/index.html](https://www.virtualdj.com/buy/index.html) or use the trial version for 10 minutes each time you restart VirtualDJ.
4. A detection window will appear next verifying the proper connection. Click OK.
5. The Akai Lpd8 should be visible in the MAPPING tab of Config and the âfactory defaultâ available/selected from the Mappings drop-down list. The factory default mapping offers the functions described in the [VirtualDJ Hardware Manual](https://virtualdj.com/manuals/hardware/akai/lpd8/setup.html), but you can also adjust them to your needs via VDJ Script actions.
6. Check the Audio set up in VirtualDJ Settings/Audio section before starting your mixing session. You will need an additional sound card or a split cable to use headphones for pre-listening, as the Akai Lpd8 does not have a built-in sound card.
